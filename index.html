  <p> <b> Academic background: </b>
    <br>
    I completed my bachelor's and master's from IIT Kharagpur in Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering (B.Tech + M.Tech, Dual degree) in 2018 with my bachelor's and master's
    <br>
    project in Neuroscience, focusing on developing a computational model to demonstrate deviant selectivity and tonotopy column formation within mouse auditory cortex. prior to this,
    <br>
    I also did an internship in the National Center for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bangalore in a computational biology lab where I studied protein docking and their mechainism.
    <br>
    Throughout my academic course, I maintained a position within the top 3 of my batch. My research interests broadly encompass the computational and theoretical aspects of stimulus 
    <br>
    selectivity within the brain and using the information-theoretic approach to study this. Since 2018, I have been carrying out my research in this field under the supervision of 
    <br> 
    Prof. Sharba Bandyopadhyay of E&ECE department, IIT Kharagpur. I am registered in the Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC) of IIT Kharagpur.

    <u> Spectral Feature selectivity in mouse adult auditory cortex </u>
    <br>
    Spectral contrast is an important feature of the auditory stimuli that helps in recognition of sound objects in different situation.
    <br>
    In the coding of complex and more naturalistic stimuli, the varying contrast characteristics of the stimuli are of much importance in maximizing the representation of relavant features and reducing redundancies 
    <br>
    in the stimulus space. In order to understand this spectral contrast selectivity shown by the auditory cortex, we probe the neural signals in response to stimuli containing variable spectral contrast.
