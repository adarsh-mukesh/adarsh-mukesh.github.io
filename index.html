  <p> Research topic: Spectral Feature selectivity in mouse adult auditory cortex
    <br>
    Spectral contrast is an important feature of the auditory stimuli that helps in recognition of sound objects in different situation.
    <br>
    In the coding of complex and more naturalistic stimuli, the varying contrast characteristics of the stimuli are more important than the simple tonal stimuli, which is generally used to see tuning and encoding properties. 
    <br>
    In order to understand this spectral contrast selectivity shown by the auditory cortex, we probe the neural signals in response to stimuli containing variable spectral contrast.
