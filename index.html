  <p> <b> Academic background: </b>
    <br>
    <br>
    I completed my bachelor's and master's from IIT Kharagpur in Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering (B.Tech + M.Tech, Dual degree) in 2018 with my bachelor's and master's
    <br>
    project in Neuroscience, focusing on developing a computational model to demonstrate deviant selectivity and tonotopy column formation within mouse auditory cortex. prior to this,
    <br>
    I also did an internship in the National Center for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bangalore in a computational biology lab where I studied protein docking and their mechainism.
    <br>
    Throughout my academic course, I maintained a position within the top 3 of my batch. My research interests broadly encompass the computational and theoretical aspects of stimulus 
    <br>
    selectivity within the brain and using the information-theoretic approach to study this. Since 2018, I have been carrying out my research in this field under the supervision of

    <a href= "http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/EC/faculty/ec-sharba#resp-tab1" target="_blank"> Prof. Sharba Bandyopadhyay </a> of E&ECE department, IIT Kharagpur. I am registered in the Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC) of IIT Kharagpur.

  <p> <b> Research topics: </b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>
    <u> Spectral Feature selectivity in mouse adult auditory cortex </u>
    <br>
    Spectral contrast is an important feature of the auditory stimuli that helps in recognition of sound objects in different situation.
    <br>
    In the coding of complex and more naturalistic stimuli, the varying contrast characteristics of the stimuli are of much importance in maximizing the representation of relavant features and reducing redundancies 
    <br>
    in the stimulus space. In order to understand this spectral contrast selectivity shown by the auditory cortex, we probe the neural signals in response to stimuli containing variable spectral contrast.
    </p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p2>
      <u> Theoretical approach to deviant selectivity </u>
      <br>
      Deviant selectivity is defined as the neural preference of rare stimuli (deviant) over a frequenct stimuli (standard). A macro-level manifestation of the deviant selectivity
      <br>
      gives rise to Mis-Match Negativity (MMN). We plan to see the parameters within the stimulus space and the neuronal level whose optimization can maximize the Mutual Information (MI) 
      <br>
      between an odd-ball stimulus and the neural response, thereby enhancing the encoding abilities of the neural circuit.
    </p2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p3>
  <u> Role of inhibitory neurons in long-scale adaptation in the auditory cortex </u>
  <br>
  Adaptation is one of the most characteristic features of the neural circuits, aimed at reducing the redundancies from the stimulus space. The neural circuits can exhibit multiple time scales of adaptations, and 
  <br>
  the inhibitory-neuron subtypes play an important modulatory role in shaping these responses. We wish to study these differences within the inhibitory subtype and hypothesize a possible mechanism which 
  <br>
  can lead to such long-scale adaptations within the neural responses in the auditory cortex.
